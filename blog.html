        <h2>Europe asks Google, Facebook, TikTok and other platforms how they’re reducing generative AI risks</h2>
        <p>European Union regulators on Thursday ratcheted up scrutiny of big tech companies including Google, Facebook and TikTok with requests for information on how they’re dealing with risks from generative artificial intelligence, such as the viral spread of deepfakes. 
           The European Commission, the EU’s executive branch, has sent questionnaires about the ways that eight platforms and search engines — including Microsoft’s Bing, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube and X, formerly Twitter — are curbing the risks of generative AI.
           The 27-nation bloc is flexing new regulatory powers acquired under the Digital Services Act, a sweeping set of regulations that took effect last year with the aim of cleaning up big online platforms and keeping users safe, under threat of hefty fines. 
           The EU is wielding the DSA and other existing regulations to govern AI until its groundbreaking rulebook for the technology takes effect. Lawmakers approved the AI Act, the world’s first comprehensive AI rules, but the provisions covering generative AI won’t kick in until next year.</p>

        <h2> Playing with dogs helps people concentrate and relax, brain recordings show</h2>
        <p>Plenty of research has investigated the bond between humans and dogs, demonstrating that canine companions can improve people’s moods, reduce blood pressure and lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol. Just looking dogs in the eye may even boost levels of oxytocin, a hormone associated with feelings of love and trust.
           A study published Wednesday did exactly that: Researchers in South Korea attached headsets of electrodes to 30 adults, then measured changes in their brainwaves as they interacted with a poodle named Aro. The results indicated that walking the dog made the participants feel more relaxed, brushing her improved concentration, and playing with her yielded both of these effects.
           For the study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, Yoo's team had participants engage in eight activities for three minutes each: meeting, playing, feeding, massaging, grooming, photographing, hugging and walking 4-year-old Aro.</p>
           After all eight activities, the participants reported feeling less stressed, fatigued and depressed.</p>

        <h2>Indonesian badminton players eye Olympics after recent wins</h2>
        <p>Indonesia hopes to regain its badminton glory at the 2024 Paris Olympics following a big win at the All England Open in Birmingham, the United Kingdom, which ended a streak of disappointing results in its world tour. The country managed to retain their men’s doubles title at the prestigious championship on Mar. 17 after the Fajar Alfian-Muhammad Rian Ardianto pair beat Malaysia in the final. </p>
           Indonesia also won gold for the men’s singles in an all-Indonesian final that saw Jonatan “Jojo” Christie beat compatriot Anthony Sinisuka Ginting. The last time the country saw an all-Indonesian final at the All England Open was 30 years ago when Hariyanto Arbi defeated Ardy Bernardus Wiranata in 1994.
           These results have been hailed by badminton fans as a return to form for a nation that excels in Badminton and has long dominated major championships, including the Olympics. Indonesia has seen poor showings in the past year, in what many badminton fans called a “decrease in quality”. 
           Indonesia for the first time ever failed to win any medals at the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou, China last year. The streak of poor performance continued into this year as Indonesia came home empty-handed from the Malaysia Open, the India Open and the French Open, all major championships deemed important to qualify for the Paris Olympics.
